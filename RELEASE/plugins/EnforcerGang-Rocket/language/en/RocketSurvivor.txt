Got a swarm of bugs coming at you? BOOM. Need to cross a gap? BAM. Heck, I’ve even blown up dinner a couple times. Charred meat tastes better when it’s crispy, alright?\n\nThey sent me here for my \"reckless behavior.\" I mean, is it really reckless if I get results? Sure, I may have leveled a couple of bases by accident. Who hasn’t? You try keeping your trigger finger calm when you're holding 60 pounds of explosive fun.\n\nNow, I’m stuck fighting off lizard-things and space bugs. But you know what? I'm having a blast (literally). Every time I hear that sweet fwoosh of a rocket sailing through the air, I know it’s gonna be a good day. And when it hits? Well, I’ve never been one for details, but the view’s always spectacular.\n\nSure, I might blow myself up one day. But until then, I’m taking this launcher and riding the boom all the way home.\n\nEnd Log. And yeah, I blew up the recorder too. Oops.",
